Symmetric encryption is performed with AES in GCM mode.

• Initialisation vector (IV) = 16 bytes (Must be randomly generated)
• Additional/associated data = not used (empty).
• Key length: 32 bytes (128 bits)
• Authentication tag: 32 bytes (128 bits). The authentication tag takes up the final 128 bits of the ciphertext.
